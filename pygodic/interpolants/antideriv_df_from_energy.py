    For the given model, get interpolant for the antiderivative of the DF as a
    function of the relative energy.

    Details
    -------

    The interpolant will be a B-spline of the given order `k`. The absisas of
    the interpolation will be a log-spaced set of energies bounded by `psi_min`
    and `psi_max`. The ordinates of the interpolation will be the set returned
    by the routine `eddington_inversion.antideriv_df`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `model` : object
    The model in consideration.

    `psi_min`, `psi_max` : float, float
    The bounds of the energy range within which the interpolant will be valid.

    `drho_dpsi_spline` : tuple
    The B-spline representation of the derivative of the mass density in the
    range of potentials bounded by `psi_min` and `psi_max`.

    `n_pts` : int
    The number of points used to obtain the interpolant.

    `k` : int (optional, default: 3)
    The order of the interpolation. Must be in the range [1, 5].

    `make_plots` : bool (optional, default: False)
    Whether to plot the resulting interpolant evaluated at a dense set, along
    with the points used to get the interpolant. This function will also plot
    the resulting numerical DF (derivative of the interpolant), as well as
    analytic curves if available.

    Returns
    -------

    out : ndarray, object
    Tuple containing, respectively, the set of energies used to obtain the
    interpolant, and the B-spline representation of the antiderivative of the
    DF.
